# Bridging Biology and Data

Hello! I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Biology (with a focus on animal physiology) and later completed a Master's degree in Biotechnology. My thesis project involved building a predictive model using microbiome data.
Currently, I'm learning more about Data Science. I started this series of posts to share my limited understanding of the connections between Biology and Data Science. I also hope to receive feedback and guidance from others along the way.

These are the slides I prepared and used for a 20-minute presentation on Biological Data for students and learners in the Data Science program at my university — the University of Science, VNU-HCM — as part of a small academic group led by Professor Thuc.
